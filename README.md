# To-Do-list
A simple to-do list webapp designed using node.js, express.js and mongodb.

## User has functionality to:

(i) add items to the list;
(ii) mark the items as completed and delete them from the 'Tasks accomplished' list;
(iii) create customized To-Do lists and delete those.

## Using the web-app:

(i) Adding Item - Task can be added to the list of 'Tasks'.

(ii) Marking completed tasks - The items marked from the 'Tasks' list, appear in the 'Tasks accomplished' list in the reverse order and these can be deleted by clicking the 'Delete' buttom.

(iii) Creating custom lists - Customized lists created can be seen by navigating to the 'My Lists' option in the navbar and created by naming the list and submitting it. These lists can be deleted using the 'Delete' button provided at the right of the list item.

In future, I plan including time for each of the To-Do tasks and displaying sorted tasks according to the mentioned time.
